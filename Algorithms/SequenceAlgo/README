The largest n calculated in =< 20s:
	1) mysterious_seq_recursive -- n = 18
			**Notes:**
			 The program completed an n= 18 in nearly 9s.
			At n=19, the program completed in around 24.5s.

	2) mysterious_seq_memoized --  20000 < n < 22000 in 20s.
			**Notes:**
				The program completed a range of n's in 20s 
			depending on the login time and the server being used. 
			I found that violet performed better than iris; it
			is my suspicion that iris is the busier server.	

Discussion
	It is apparent that the memoized version saves an exponential amount 
of time but I'm curious about it's memory consumption. Also, it is interesting
enough to note that increasing the size of n for the memoized program only 
fractionally increases the time to completion. Where for the simple recursive
version, the time to completion increases exponentially with an increase in n.
	

Also interesting to note, in the memoized version, at n=57 to n = 21000+ (as far as
I've tried) the result will always be equal to 808. I'm not sure if this 
is due to an overflow issue or if that is truly the last 3 digits of every 
number in the sequence on and after n=57; the former seems more likely 
than the latter.
