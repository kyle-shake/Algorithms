README FOR: Haversine calculator

To compile and run program: 
	--type "./havTest.sh <option>"
	--options are: "vector"
			**Compiles program using vectors, then
			tests all text files under the ./tests/
			director 
		       "list"
			**LIST DOES NOT WORK. IT WILL COMPILE BUT
			DURING EXECUTION, A SEGMENTATION FAULT OCCURS

		       Any other argument passed to script will cause this
			README to print with an error message
	OR

        --type "make" 
		**THIS WILL ONLY CREATE THE VECTOR BASED PROGRAM

Files Necessary for Compilation: HaversineWVector.cpp, HaversineWList.cpp,
Location.cpp, Location.h, LinkedList.cpp, LinkedList.h

Program Description: Program takes user input, usually in form of text file, of
list of cities or locations and that respective location's latitude and longitude. 
Sorts the cities by longitude, reports the West and East most cities, and 
calculates the distance between each city using the Haversine formula. Then
it does the same for latitude. 

Program Assumptions: 
	--Each city/location and it's latitude/longitude is on
a separate line. 
	--The cityname, latitude, and longitude are seperated by a
space in the format: "Cityname Latitude Longitude"
		***However, program will work with data
		delimited by multiple spaces!!!

Current Status:
	-- Linked List based haversine Calculator does not work! It causes a 
	segmentation fault. Debugging still in progress
	-- Vector based Haversine Calculator DOES work! Need to verify that results
	are accurate
