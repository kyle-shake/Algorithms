PURPOSE:
-----------------------------------------------
This directory is a collection of two C++ files that
calculate Fibonacci's sequence for some integer n
(n >= 0) along with a test script to show the run 
time differences between recursive function calls
and recursive function calls along with a memoization
technique
-----------------------------------------------


CONTENTS:
-----------------------------------------------
This directory and its subdirectory contains
  -- Two C++ program files:
     * recursive_fib.cpp
     * memoization_fib.cpp
  -- One test script:
     *test.sh
  -- One time test input file:
     *time_test.in
  -- A number #  of test files in ./tests:
     *input#.in
-----------------------------------------------


HOW TO:
-----------------------------------------------
**FIRST**
- Ensure the test script is executable
  chmod u+x ./test.sh

- How to time test the two programs:
  ./test.sh time

- How to test the two programs (untimed):
  ./test.sh cpp

- How to manually compile cpp
  g++ -std=c++11 cpp/file_name.cpp -o cpp/file_name.out

- How to manually run cpp
  ./cpp/file_name.out < ./tests/input#.in

- How to manually run cpp with timing info
  ./cpp/file_name.out -t < ./tests/input#.in
